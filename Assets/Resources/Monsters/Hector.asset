  description: Dusclops has a roundish gray body with two stubby legs. Its body is
    hollow and can absorb anything much like a black hole. It has a single red eye
    and three tooth-like projections. It has two wispy, light gray growths coming
    out of its shoulders and one on top of its head. Its light gray hands appear
    to be directly attached to its body. It will wave these hands to hypnotize opponents
    and then force them to do as it wills. Dusclops preys on drifting will-o'-the-wisps,
    sucking them into its body. It usually lives in thick forests.
