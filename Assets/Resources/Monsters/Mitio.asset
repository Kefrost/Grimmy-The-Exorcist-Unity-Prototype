  description: "Mewtwo is a Pok\xE9mon created by science. It is a bipedal, humanoid
    creature with some feline features. It is primarily gray with a long, purple
    tail. On top of its head are two short, blunt horns, and it has purple eyes.
    A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing
    its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate.
    The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick
    at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb."
